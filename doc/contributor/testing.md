# TruffleRuby's Testing Strategy

This document lists the tests that we run on TruffleRuby. They're listed in the
order in which we normally run them. If you have less time for testing in
whatever configuration you have, run the tests from the beginning of the list
until you run out of time.

## Docker test images

Docker images in `test/truffle/docker` are executable documentation of this
testing strategy, based on multiple Linux distributions.

## Testing functionality

### Trivial execution

You can test that TruffleRuby is functional at a most primitive level by
printing a number.

```
ruby -e 'puts 14'
```

###Â Fast specs

Fast specs test only those specs which do not do things that take more than a
few ms, such as starting new interpreters. It runs in around a minute.

For example, `jt test fast` in the source repository, or `TOOD` for an external
binary.

### Full specs

The full set of specs from `ruby/spec` are broken down into these categories and
normally run in this order:

* `:language` (around a minute and a half)
* `:core` (around seven minutes)
* `:library` (around half a minute)
* `:command_line` (around three minutes)
* `:security` (around a minute)

For example, `jt test :language`, or `TOOD` for an external binary.

We have written additional specs using the same MSpec test system to cover
functionality specific to TruffleRuby:

* `:truffle` (around two minutes)

`jt test specs` runs all the above listed specs in around ten minutes, but
generally it's a good idea to break the tests down so that you can more easily
see progress.

### MRI tests

MRI's test suite isn't broken down into modules as the specs are - it's one
global test of tests. This runs in around four minutes.

For example, `jt test mri`, or `TOOD` for an external binary.

## Testing C extensions

### Basic C extension tests

Basic tests of the foundations of C extension functionality are run by `jt test
cexts` in around two minutes. This only works in the source repository as it's a
bit lower level - it can't be run on an external binary.

### C extension specs

C extension specs. Runs in around three minutes.

For example, `jt test --sulong :capi`, or `TOOD` for an external binary.

### C extension MRI tests

For example, `jt test mri --sulong test/mri/tests/cext`, or `TOOD` for an
external binary.

## Wider tests

### Integration tests

### Gem tests

### Ecosystem tests

## Chaos testing

## Testing compilation

### Partial evaluation tests

### On-stack-replacement tests

### CWFY

### STF-opt

### TP-opt

## Benchmarks

### Enabling compilation

You may initially want to run all the tests previously described with
compilation disabled. They can then also be used to progressively test
compilation, using these configurations in turn:

#### With compilation simply enabled

TODO does this work?

TODO how long does it take?

#### With a low compilation threshold and foreground compilation

TODO does this work?

TODO how long does it take?

#### With immediate compilation and foreground compilation

TODO does this work?

TODO how long does it take?

## Native image

The native image should be tested by running all the previous tests on the
native executable.

## Isolating tests from source in the repository

## Testing binary distributions

Binary distributions (binary tarballs of GraalVM) can be tested using the Docker
test images, which run all of the tests described here.
