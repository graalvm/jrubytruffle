# Rules for GitHub's Linguist language-classification system. We're abusing the
# 'vendored' attribute to exclude files as a lot of this isn't really vendored,
# and a whole lot of actually vendored code isn't listed! What we want to do is
# make the stats accurate for what is actually runtime code.

# Ignore everything that isn't actually runtime code
