# All Ruby benchmarks

These are all the useful Ruby benchmarks I could find.

I recommend running them using
[Benchmark-Interface](https://github.com/jruby/benchmark-interface), and the
[`benchmark/ips`](https://github.com/jruby/benchmark-interface) backend in
the first instance.

In most instances we have attempted to configure benchmarks to run at least an
iteration per second.
