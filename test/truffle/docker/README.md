# Docker Test Images

These are Dockerfiles to test TruffleRuby builds on different Linux
distributions. They could also serve as sources on which to base a deployment
image, but we'd recommend the official GraalVM Dockerfile for that.

https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/GraalVM

These Dockerfiles run the tests as part of the image build, so if the image
successfully builds then the tests have all passed.

You need to put the built GraalVM binary tarball into the same directory as the
Dockerfile, and update the Dockerfile for the version.

```
$ docker build -t truffleruby-test-ubuntu . build-args...
```

You need to specify these build args:

* `--build-arg GRAALVM_VERSION=...`
* `--build-arg GRAALVM_TARBALL=...`
* `--build-arg TRUFFLERUBY_JAR=...`
* `--build-arg REBUILD_IMAGES=true` if you want to rebuild images (you do with EE)
* `--build-arg TEST_BRANCH=master` unless you want to test against the tag for the GraalVM version

Docker will need to run the container with at least 8 GB of RAM if you are using
virtualisation, to give enough space for the native image to build.

Note that the Oracle Linux Dockerfile needs the `oraclelinux-llvm` image from
`tool/docker/oraclelinux-llvm`.

## Ruby Managers

Ruby Managers are also tested by Dockerfiles. These all run on Ubuntu. We test
rbenv, chruby, and RVM.

```
$ docker build -t truffleruby-test-rbenv . build-args...
```

You need to specify these build args:

* `--build-arg GRAALVM_VERSION=...`
* `--build-arg GRAALVM_TARBALL=...`
* `--build-arg TRUFFLERUBY_JAR=...`
* `--build-arg REBUILD_IMAGES=true` if you want to rebuild images (you do with EE)
